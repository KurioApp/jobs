# Internship - Data Science Engineer

Interested in building a better product by using data? Whatever we do, whether it's decision making, or dealing with machine learning problems, we need data.

In Kurio, we're partnering with hundreds of publishers. We collect bunch of data from our mobile application. These make us a fun place for doing data science projects, whether it's a simple classification problem, or complex recommender system.

In this team, you will get to work on both engineering-related tasks and data science-related tasks.

The **data-science-related tasks** might include:

- Maintain, and if possible, improve existing models (retrain) used in production environment
- Opportunities for researching state-of-the-art machine learning models (i.e. [Named-Entity-Recognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918314832))
- Working with data analysis projects along with our data analysts

The **engineering-related tasks** are **developing services** that use the model in the **production** environment. Some examples of engineering-related tasks include:

- Building simple APIs that utilize machine learning model.
- Build services that further enhance the newsfeed algorithm (i.e. deduplication, personalization).
- Some ETL jobs

We write 2 kinds of code:

1. **Scripting code**

   A script to get the job done. Just remember that eventually, somebody else will take a look at your code, and that someone could be your future self. Try to be mindful and write a readable code.

2. **Production-level code**

   No slow-performing codes are allowed. Fully comply with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
