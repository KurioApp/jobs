# Internship - Data Science Engineer

Are you the one who's interested in building a better product by using data? Kurio makes
decision by looking at the data, hence we value data. As data science engineer, you will get to
work on some engineering-related tasks like building API, and some data
science-related tasks like classifications, clustering, etc.

There are 2 kinds of code that we write: **scripting** code and **production-ready** code.
For scripting, we just want the script to get the job done.
For production-level code, we need it to be production-ready, meaning no slow-performing codes are allowed.

## What you will do

- Bunch of classifiers
  - Gathering and Cleaning data
  - Modeling
  - Build API that uses the machine learning model

## Qualifications

- Kurio's values (Get sh*t done, Be Bold, Stay Curious, Excellence, Collaboration)
- Knowledge in computer science is a must (things like data structure, OOP)
- Have a foundation on machine learning concepts and algorithms (text-related is preferred)
- Python
- SQL vs NoSQL Database (i.e. MySQL, MongoDB)
- Familiar with Git

## Preferred qualifications

- Able to scrape website for gathering training data
- Knowledge on several data-science-related tools
