# Data Science Engineer

Are you the one who's interested in building a better product by using data? Kurio makes decision by looking at the data, hence we value data. As data science engineer, you will get to work on some engineering-related tasks like building API in a TDD fashion, and some data science-related tasks like classifications, clustering, etc. There are 2 kinds of code that we write: scripting code and production-level code. For scripting, we just want the script to get the job done. For production-level code, we need it to be production-ready, meaning no slow-performing codes are allowed.



## What you will do

- Bunch of classifiers
- Clustering
- Newsfeed scoring (incld. recommender engine)



## Qualifications

- Kurio's values (Get sh*t done, Be Bold, Stay Curious, Excellence, Collaboration)
- Knowledge in computer-science is a must
- Have a foundation on machine learning concepts and algorithms (text-related is preferred)
- Able to scrape website for gathering training data (and cleaning)
- Able to query (SQL like MySQL, NoSQL like MongoDB)
- Able to code in Python (knowing Golang is a plus)
- Familiar with Git
- Knowledge on containerized-solutions (docker, kubernetes) is a bonus



## Preferred qualifications

- Experienced on software architecture
- Experienced on production-level machine learning systems
- Knows dev-ops related stuff
